## Technical Documentation

### DogApi
**DogApi** is a Swift package designed to fetch data from remote URLs. This architectural choice helps us consolidate code for API calls across the main app and the widget extension, ensuring code efficiency.


In anticipation of potential future requirements, we've kept the door open for further expansion with an **ApiManager**, though currently, we employ a simple approach since only one API request is required. This approach is implemented through **DogService**, which provides an interface for our implementation.

We have **DogServiceDefault** for live data and **DogServiceDefaultMock** for unit testing with JSON mocked data.

### Widget Extension
Creating the widget extension was a straightforward process. We opted for a classic widget setup without selecting any additional options during creation.

To add the button, we followed Apple's guidelines as outlined in their [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/adding-interactivity-to-widgets-and-live-activities). Here's the essential code snippet:

```swift
Button(intent: DogSearch()) {
  Image(systemName: "shuffle")
    .foregroundStyle(.white)
    .font(.title3)
    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
}
```

Enjoy your widget and the delightful world of random dogs on your iOS 17 home screen! üêæ
